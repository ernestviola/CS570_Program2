I used inout2.c as a template from Foster for 'getword.c'.
I believe that everything works perfectly under all conditions. However, there seems to be a bug with recurrent commands when trying to execute the builtin commands, this is caused by having the builtin commands outside of a child, so during a failed attempt it will still print the prompt rather than immediately failing.
I didn't implement any of the extra credit.
Handled '< >' and '> <' as errors as it was not specified to what functionality was 
supposed to be given.
